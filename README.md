> A virtual DOM component (view).

Virtual components are a thin wrapper around a render method which takes the
state and returns a virtual DOM representation.

## Getting Started

Install the module with: `npm install virtual-dom-component`

## Usage

```javascript
var h = require('virtual-hyperscript');

var Profile = function(state) {
  return h('div', null,
    h('h1', null, state.name),
    h('img', { src: state.avatarURL })
  );
};

// with local state
var Profile = function(state) {
  return h('div', null,
    h('h1', null, state.name)),
    h('img', { src: this.url(state.gid) })
  );
}.bind({
  fullName: function(first, last) {
    return [first, last].join(' ');
  },
  url: function(gid) {
    return 'https://gravatar.com/' + gid;
  }
});

// using JSX
var Profile = function(state) {
  return <div>
    <h1>{state.name}</h1>
    <img src={state.avatarURL } />
  </div>;
};


var vNode = Profile(state);
```
